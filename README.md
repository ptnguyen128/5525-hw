# Machine Learning Homework

(in progress)  

Implemented several machine learning and deep learning models from scratch.  
Language: Python  

Implemented algorithms:  
- Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis  
- Bivariate Gaussian Generative Model (multinomial classification)  
- (Multinomial) Logistic Regression   
- Naive-Bayes with marginal Gaussian distributions (GNB)
